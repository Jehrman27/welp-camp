This project is for a website that users can use to add their own campgrounds
or search for other campgrounds and review their experiences.

The project makes use of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap5, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose.
More technologies will likely be used as the project progresses.

To install and host a local version of the website:
- Clone this repo
- Run 'npm install' in the root directory of the repo
- Run 'node app.js' in the root directory to serve the site locally
- Open your web browser to localhost:3000

--Note: Currently only the campgrounds are available, so you should navigate to localhost:3000/campgrounds
to see the progress of the project
